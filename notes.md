# Notes on branch: Heroku1

- This branch originated from the backend_dev_model branch.
- It creates a mechanism to easily identify the point at which the quickfit django backend was first deployed to heroku (evening of Aug 10). 
- Many changes and improvements were made from that point on the postgres1 branch.  I plan to merge the postgres1 branch into the backend_model_dev branch.
- If we need to revert to this earlier version, development can continue on this branch.
